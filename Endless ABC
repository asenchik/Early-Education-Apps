Endless ABC is an iPad app that lets children practice connecting letter sounds to their corresponding images while teaching new vocabulary meanings and spelling. The app comes with two words per letter and allows for the purchase of more words. Upon clicking on a word, a letter puzzle shows up with the letters scattered around the screen. When a letter is touched, it animates and repeats the letter sound until the child lets go of it. Once the puzzle is completed, all of the letters animate, cheering for the child. A cartoon appears visually demonstrating the meaning of the word, followed by a verbal explanation of the word. This app manages to reach hands-on, visual, and auditory learners in a way that is interesting and fun for children. 

The app is also versatile, allowing children to pick two letters at a time. The letter sounds repeat back and forth until one of the letters is released. Additionally, it only makes the sound of the letter needed for the word (i.e. If it's a short "e" word, the child will only hear the short "e" sound.). This allows parents and teachers to identify and discuss with children the different phonics rules for English.
